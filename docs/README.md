# Documentation

This directory contains the application specification and technical documentation.

## Files

- **SPECIFICATION.md** - Main application specification. This is the single source of truth for what the application does, how it works, and what features it includes. Updated as features are built.

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Keep it current**: The specification should always reflect the current state of the application
- **Update on feature completion**: When implementing features, update the specification with details
- **Write for all audiences**: Use clear language that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand
- **Include examples**: Where helpful, include code examples or usage patterns
- **Maintain change log**: Document significant changes in the change log section

## When to Update

Update the specification when:
- ✅ Implementing a new feature
- ✅ Adding new models or significant model changes
- ✅ Adding new routes or API endpoints
- ✅ Making architectural decisions
- ✅ Changing deployment configuration

Don't update for:
- ❌ Minor bug fixes
- ❌ Code refactoring (unless behavior changes)
- ❌ Styling changes only
