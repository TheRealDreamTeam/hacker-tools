// Page transition animations for full page reloads only
// Turbo navigation is fast and doesn't need animations
// FOUC prevention is handled via inline styles in layout

// Animation class applied on full page reload
// Fades in the page content smoothly
// Duration: 250ms is optimal for page transitions - fast enough to feel responsive,
// slow enough to be smooth and noticeable without feeling sluggish
// Easing: ease-out feels more natural for fade-ins (starts fast, ends slow)
